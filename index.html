        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>
            Nathan Ortiz is a 25-year-old student, studying software development in the <mark>Full Stack Development Immersive</mark> program at <mark>San Diego Global Knowledge University.</mark> 
            He currently has <b>zero</b> experience in programming, but makes up for it with a strong sense of <i>determination,</i> 
            <i>will</i>, and <i>tenacious drive.</i>
           <p>
            Though his family and peers may view him as rash or <del>irresolute,</del> <del>wavering</del> indecisive, his mind is strewn with constant thoughts, analysis, and rumination.
            His abrupt changes <sup>along</sup> <sub>the</sub> <sup>beaten</sup> <sub>paths</sub> that lay before him are directly related to his ability to quickly recognize when one is not meant for him to take. 
            From sailing the vast oceans around the world in the United States Navy and bouncing drunkards from bars, to providing 
            people with their favorite Trader Joeâ€™s snacks, his unconventional journey is what brought him to the path of software development. 
            </p>
            His broad work experience has led him to the conclusion that he will <ins>never</ins> be happy in a stagnant industry. 
            He needs that constant push- <em>to learn</em> and <em>to do.</em> His happiness rests on the opportunity to excel at work, 
            to solve complex problems, and to mindfully engage with improving his skills. 
            Why? Because standing still will always be his biggest <small>fear.</small>
            He knows that here, in this ever-changing field of technology, he will make his mobile home.
